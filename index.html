	REVERSING DEFORESTATION IS COMPLICATED
	<BR>
PLANTING TREES IS SIMPLE
	<BR>
WHAT'S EVEN EASIER IS JUST LETTING OUR TREES BE.
	<BR>
~GO PAPERLESS~<BR>
	<BR>By the year 2030, we might only have 10% of Rainforests left and it can all disappear in a hundred years.

  <p>THE TROPICS LOST 11.9 MILLION HECTARES OF TREE COVER IN 2019<BR><BR>Logging operations, which provide the world’s wood and paper products, also fell countless trees each year.<br> Loggers, some of them acting illegally, also build roads to access more and more remote forests—which leads to further deforestation. </p>

  <p> Eighty percent of Earth’s land animals and plants live in forests, and deforestation threatens species including the orangutan, Sumatran tiger, and many species of birds. <br><br>UP TO 28,000 SPECIES ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME EXTINCT BY THE NEXT QUARTER OF THE CENTURY DUE TO DEFORESTATION. </p>

  <p>We can greatly reduce our carbon footprint by simply going paperless. It's not only amazing for our forests, but can save us time, make our information secure and make dealing with data easier than ever before.<br>
